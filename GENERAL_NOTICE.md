# General Notice: Synthetic Dataset Usage Guidelines  

This repository contains **synthetic data** generated for various purposes, such as testing, demonstration, educational use, or software development. The data is entirely artificial and does not represent real individuals, organizations, or transactions.  

---  

## Purpose  

The synthetic dataset in this repository is intended for:  
- **Testing**: Validating software systems, pipelines, or algorithms.  
- **Demonstration**: Showcasing tools, data handling techniques, or workflows.  
- **Educational Use**: Training or teaching data analysis, data science, or machine learning concepts.  

This dataset is not suitable for production environments or use cases requiring real data.

## Key Details  

1. **Data Generation**:  
   - The synthetic data was created using Python libraries (e.g., **Faker**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**) or custom algorithms.  
   - Fields such as `Name`, `Email`, `Address`, `Transaction Details`, or others are randomly generated. They are designed to simulate real-world data formats without referencing actual entities.  

2. **Legal and Compliance**:  
   - Since the data is synthetic, it does not fall under the scope of data protection regulations, including:  
     - The **Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)**.  
     - The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.  
   - The tools and libraries used comply with their respective licenses (e.g., MIT License for Faker).  

3. **Ethical Use**:  
   - Do not misrepresent synthetic data as real in any professional, academic, or public setting.  
   - Ensure transparency about the synthetic nature of the data when sharing or presenting it.
